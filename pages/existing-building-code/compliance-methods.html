            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <h2>Compliance Methods</h2>
            <h3>Prescriptive Compliance Method</h3>
            <p>The Prescriptive Compliance Method is a straightforward approach where existing buildings must comply with specific requirements outlined in Chapter 4 of the NCEBC. This method:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provides clear requirements by building element</li>
                <li>Is suitable for most common renovation projects</li>
                <li>Doesn't require complex analysis or calculations</li>
                <li>May be more restrictive for certain historic structures</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Work Area Compliance Method</h3>
            <p>The Work Area Compliance Method addresses compliance based on the classification of work and the extent of the work area. It categorizes work as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Level 1 Alterations: Removal and replacement of existing materials with like materials</li>
                <li>Level 2 Alterations: Reconfiguration of space, addition or elimination of doors/windows</li>
                <li>Level 3 Alterations: Work area exceeding 50% of the building area</li>
                <li>Change of Occupancy: Changing the use of a space</li>
                <li>Additions: New construction connected to an existing building</li>
                <li>Historic Buildings: Special provisions for designated historic buildings</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Performance Compliance Method</h3>
            <p>The Performance Compliance Method allows flexibility by using a scoring system to evaluate safety features. This method:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Uses a numerical scoring system</li>
                <li>Evaluates fire safety, means of egress, and general safety</li>
                <li>Allows trade-offs between building systems</li>
                <li>Requires thorough documentation and calculations</li>
                <li>Is suitable for complex or unusual buildings</li>
            </ul>
